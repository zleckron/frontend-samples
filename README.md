## Introduction
None of these projects are still hosted, so to view to the pages you can clone this repository and open the ``.html``/``.htm`` files in each project.  

### HackUMBC Workshop 2019
In Fall of 2019 for the UMBC's Hackathon HackUMBC, I created and presented a sample site to demonstrate some web development basics to workshop attendees.
All (non-image) files were created by me individually. This site is not hosted.

### Technica 2019 Web App
For UMD's 2019 Hackathon Technica, I worked with a group of others to make a web app that picks from a list of recipes given user input. My team used Flask as our framework, so that's why some parts of the files may look unconventional, such as the formatting for including images by url.  
I included extra files here for context. The files I worked on are ___templates/index.html___, ___templates/results.html___, ___styles/mainpage.css___, and ___food.py___.

### CSEdu Workshop 2019
For UMBC's CS Education Club, I worked with one peer to develop a workshop to show attendees how to use Bulma with SASS/SCSS versions of CSS with node.js.  
I created all of the files in that directory as starter files for attendees to customize, except for ___css/main.css___, which is provided by Bulma.  
This setup is reliant on the site being hosted, so ___HelloWorld.html___ and ___index.html___ will not display correctly in the browser with the associated pictures.  
I wrote this short powerpoint explaining Bulma and CSS syntax: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/124nU7ZKkGKpjYBQ6iwncdnb-aAI8JUVX2V-SuWC8cfA/edit?usp=sharing  
And wrote the steps in this instructions page: https://github.com/zleckron/cseduclub#square-who-lets-build-a-portfolio-site-with-htmlscss
